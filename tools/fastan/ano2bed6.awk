# FasTAN annotation (.1ano, ONEcode) -> BED6, in SCAFFOLD coordinates.
#
# ⛔ READ THE ANNOTATION FILE, NOT ANOtoBED's BED. `ANOtoBED` emits CONTIG-relative coordinates
# under the SCAFFOLD's name, so on any assembly with internal N-gaps every interval after the first
# gap is reported at the wrong place -- and the file it names cannot be used with it. Measured with
# planted ground truth: a scaffold `chrX` holding a 20-mer array at 500-1700 and a 25-mer array at
# 3500-4750, split by an 800 bp N-gap at 2200:
#
#     planted    chrX  500 1700   |  chrX 3500 4750
#     tantan     chrX  519 1702   |  chrX 3523 4752      (independent, correct)
#     ANOtoBED   chrX  500 1682   |  chrX  499 1725      <- second array 3 kb to its left,
#                                                           and the two intervals OVERLAP
#
# Nothing upstream loses anything. The .1ano itself is CORRECT -- `M 0 500 1682` and
# `M 0 3499 4725`, scaffold-relative, per its own declared schema
# ("~ O M 3 3 INT 3 INT 3 INT   scaffold index, beg,end pair"). ANOtoBED subtracts a contig offset
# it should not. So this reads the authoritative file through `ONEview`, its declared reader, and
# is byte-identical to the old pipeline wherever ANOtoBED was already right (a gapless scaffold).
#
# ONEcode records used, in file order:
#     S <len> <name>          a scaffold; they appear in index order 0, 1, 2, ...
#     M <scaf> <beg> <end>    an annotated interval, ALREADY scaffold-relative
#     L <len> <unit>          label for the preceding M -- FasTAN puts the repeat unit length here
#     X <divergence>          score for the preceding M
# Flush on the NEXT M or at END, never on a trailing optional record: `P` (the parse partition) is
# present for FasTAN and need not be for another annotator.

    # 10% -> 12, 20% -> 28. So X RISES as the array degrades, on roughly a percent scale -- while
    # the old code passed it straight into BED column 5 as "identity, clamped 0-1000 (UCSC
    # grayscale)". In a hub track that renders the PUREST arrays palest, inverted against every
    # other track here, and compressed into the bottom 3% of the range. Mapped to an
    # identity-like 0-1000 where higher is better, which is what column 5 means.
